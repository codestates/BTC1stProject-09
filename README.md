**Wallet and Tx Explorer on Internet Computer Network**

The project was bootstrapped using `npm init gatsby`, with the following modifications:

- Changing `src/pages/index.js` to be our new app
- adding `dfx.json` to deploy the application on the IC

Then, to add an IC backend,

- Adds `src/backend` with HashMap logic
- adds `gatsby-node` to configure webpack to handle environment variables for the dfx-generated actor

## Quickstart

Follow directions to install `dfx` if you don't have it yet: https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/index.html
